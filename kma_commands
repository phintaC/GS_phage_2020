For the customised database (see Al-Shayeb et al. 2020) the supplementary GenBank files of the 364 determined sequences
(6 sequences were of unknown origin and therefore left out, another 4 sequences were plasmids and also left out) 
352 sequences were included in the project. All sequences were of phage origin. 
The GenBank files of the 352 positively identified phage sequences were converted to FASTA files using a small home-made script
(see gbk_fsa.py) which took all files in a directory and extracted their sequences denoted by a header corresponding to the 
respective filename. Subsequently, the database was indexed for use in KMA. Indexing was done by the following call: 
 
kma_index -i phage_ecosystem_2020.fsa -o phage_ecosystem_2020

When the database has been indexed, the job script and files related to this were prepared. All files were copied from kvI_201903012
and edited accordingly, such that the samples would be mapped against the customised database.
